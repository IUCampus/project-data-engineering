# Habit Tracker (CLI-based)

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to design and implement a data system for storing and managing environmental sensor data collected by a municipality. The system must reliably handle data from various sensor types, be scalable and maintainable in the long term, and support future expansion with new metrics such as COâ‚‚ levels, fine dust, or noise. Furthermore, it should support integration with frontend applications for real-time citizen alerts.

## Features
- Analyze what data each sensor sends (e.g., timestamp, location, measurement type, value).
- Design data flow from sensor to storage.
- Decide on storage type like NoSQL.
- Define thresholds for each environmental metric.
- Create logic for real-time analysis and detection of dangerous values.
- Implement mechanisms to send warnings to frontend apps or directly to citizens.
  
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IUCampus/project-data-engineering.git
cd sensor-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the sensor-app:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- This will load sample data first (data-loader), and then run FastAPI.
- Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for Swagger UI.
